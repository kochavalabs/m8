# m8 
## Pronounced: m-ate 
---

The `m8` command line tool lets you interact with Mazzaroth nodes. For configuration, `m8` looks for a file named `cfg.yaml` in the `$HOME/.m8/` directory. However, you can specify other setting a env variable of `M8_CFG_PATH` or setting the global `--cfg-path` flag.


### Syntax 

m8 follows the following syntax to run commands from your terminal: 

```
m8 [resource] [verb] [noun] [flags]
```

where `resource`, `verb`, `noun`, and `flags` are: 

- todo
- holder

**Flags that you specify from the command line override default values and any correspoding environemnt variables**

If you need help, run `m8 help` from your terminal.
